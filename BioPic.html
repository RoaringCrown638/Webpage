                    Every once in a while comes along a man whose out-of-the-world thinking and spirit covertly revolutionizes the world. Alan Turing was one of such geniuses

                    Born in Paddington, London on 23rd June, 1912, Alan Mathison Turing was a very bright student and showed interest in Mathematics and Science from a young age. Although unconventional in his methodology and thought, his unique genius was noted by his school teachers. After school he enrolled at King's College (present day Cambridge) where he was given much more space to explore his ideas.

                    In 1936 Turing presented "On Computable Numbersm with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem"/ In this paper, he outlined a mechanism that could “compute everything that is computable.” It followed a set of pre-set instructions and output a result generated by an input symbol. This machine was later coined the term “Turing Machine.” and is usually referred to as the precursor of modern computers. He later went on to get a PHD from Princeton University on Cryptology and then work with the government’s code-breaking branch.

                    Perhaps the most well known thing about Turing is the role he played in World War 2. Amidst the heated tension between the Allies and Axis forces, Alan Turing found a way to decode Axis communication and aided the Allies to victory. By doing so, he managed to save millions of lives and shortened the war by several years.

                    Turing’s achievements, however, did not end there. After the war Turing developed interest in biology and nature. He made connections between nature’s mathematical patterns and the functioning of a computer. He referred to the human brain as a large unorganized machine that is trained, a statement that can widely be observed in almost every Artificial Intelligence based program in present day. He is, therefore, regarded as the founding father of AI.

                    Turing’s late life was plagued with misfortune. Since homosexuality was considered a crime in the early 1950s, Turing was put through hormonal treatment. On 7th June, 1954, Alan Turing was found dead on his bed due to cyanide poisoning. Many blame the treatment for his death, however no evidence found linked the two together, leaving little explanation as to why he died. However it might have happened, Alan Turing left us with an opportunity to sectione deeper into the field of Computer Science, and will thus always be an important name to remember.
